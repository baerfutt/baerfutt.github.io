* Disclaimers
*Physical*: these recommendations serve to illuminate /shoes/ which help the foot work.  There is no substitute for going barefoot when running! *None*! 

*Financial*: By clicking on the links below and purchasing anything, I get a small kickback which I use to fund further workshops. Thank you!



* Criteria for following recommendations
  - Very flexible sole to encourage the foot to pronate, load, and grapple
    while walking and running, i.e.
    - *allow the foot be a foot*
  - No high-heels
  - Lightweight
  - Inexpensive

* Recommendation: XeroShoes
  - My favorite: Huarache-style DIY sandals
  - Their other shoes are great too

* Other footwear
I am currently evaluating other footwear. If you have any suggestions drop me a line please.

Interesting tested shoes:
  - vivobarefoot
    - So far: good /normal/ shoes 
    - the sole is generally too stiff
  - vibram fivefingers
    - good ground connection
    - stink horribly without a regular vinegar treatment
    - Expensive relative to their durability
